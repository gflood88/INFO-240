		<h2>Virtual Reality Action Plan</h2>
		
		<p> We will utilize our virtual reality (VR) and video streaming capabilities to promote the library to surrounding communities by developing a mobile VR station that will allow users to interact with the collection virtually and also double as an advertising platform for the library.</p>

		<p>“Virtual reality is an important technology that continues to evolve, grow, and integrate into the lives of our library users and libraries can offer access to these technologies to create unique learning and experiential opportunities for users” (Pope, 2018). The Lucille Ball Library will leverage the surge in VR use and integration across libraries by retrofitting a bookmobile into a mobile VR station. This mobile VR station will be called ‘The Lucille Ball Experience’ and will satisfy three goals.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Virtual Reality viewing of popular I Love Lucy episodes and the Lucille Ball Comedy Festival (Whetsell, 2018). The use of VR allows users an immersive experience that is free from distractions of everyday, which increases retention of information and makes users feel as if they are part of the scene instead of just watching a scene (Bond, 2018). Through the use of VR headsets, patrons will be able to interact with I Love Lucy episodes by being able to experience the show from the various characters viewpoints, explore sets, and can even reenact scenes as their favorite character. By digitally recreating each episode and utilizing all video footage, computers will be able to accurately modernize and reproduce key episodes of the show to take full advantage of VR technology. Each year the Lucy-Desi Museum hosts the Lucille Ball Comedy Festival in Jamestown, New York, however given that the Lucille Ball Library is located in Chatsworth, California; many patrons may not be able to experience the festival first hand. By having museum staff outfitted with 360° cameras that rove around the festival and having stereoscopic cameras situated around the venue and stage (Waniata, 2018), patrons will be able to explore the festival and watch performances free from distraction and without having to book a flight to New York.</li>

				<li>Virtual reality browsing and interacting with the Lucille Ball Library exhibits and the Lucy-Desi Museum exhibits (Lucy-Desi, 2015). VR has become a growing trend among museums around the world and has been utilized to overcome physical, economic, and accessibility barriers. The National Museum of Finland and Kramer Museum have both been on the cutting edge of implementing VR by showcasing over 70 artifacts all strictly in VR and allowing patrons to virtually enter a painting and interact with subjects in the painting (Coats, 2018). By utilizing 360° cameras to record objects patrons will be able to interact with current exhibits at the Lucille Ball Library and the Lucy-Desi Museum. Stereoscopic cameras will allow patrons to not only move around objects, but could also pick them up and move them around.</li>
				<li>The Lucille Ball Experience will serve as a mobile billboard and mobile extension of the Lucille Ball Library. According to a recent study by transportation analytic company Inrix, “Los Angeles drivers spent an average of 102 hours in traffic during peak times” (Angelenos, 2018) and according to the Department of Motor Vehicles there are over 7,762,453 registered vehicles in Los Angeles County (Los Angeles Almanac, 2018). By having the Lucille Ball Experience vehicle vinyl wrapped with the library’s logo, contact information, and social media links; the library is able to advertise to a captive audience on route to various locations through Los Angeles. Additionally by having a mobile VR station the library is able to bring the library to patrons who are unable to come to Chatsworth. Gavin Wolterjer (2018), writer for the Public Library Association, outlines the importance of bookmobiles to promote libraries, create a mobile community space, and provide access to information and technology that impoverished communities may not get to experience. The Lucille Ball Experience will also frequent various colleges in to promote the Lucille Ball Library and foster community partnerships with campuses.</li>

		<h3 id="budgets">Budget</h3>
		
		<p>Funding will be taken directly from the $26 million annual budget of the Lucy-Desi Museum as well as grants from outside investors and donors. We will also explore funding from Chatsworth City Council. The purchase and customization of the VR station vehicle is anticipated to be the most significant cost at an estimated $500,000 (Waite, 2018). The VR program development cost to take advantage of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets is $200,000 (Levski, n.d.). The VR station will utilize one Oculus Rift VR headset and one HTC Vive headset which combined cost $1000. By having both platforms the VR station is guaranteed to be able to play all VR programs without having to choose between one platform and another. In order to run the headsets we will purchase two Origin Neuron desktop computers for $2000 (Buzzi, 2018). In order to have patrons see what VR users are seeing will purchase four TCL 4K televisions for $900 (Best, n.d.). We will also purchase a VR camera that will allow us to digitize current and future objects, and the Lucille Ball Comedy Festival for $17,000 (Mooovr, n.d.). An estimated $12,000 will be utilized for marketing of the Lucille Ball Experience and $64,000 will be used for two employees to operate the mobile VR station. The total required budget needed to successfully implement the Lucille Ball Experience is $796,900.</p>
		
		<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>

		<p>The Lucille Ball Library staff will continue to monitor the VR station to determine value and any changes that need to make to better serve our patrons. The public relations manager will monitor patron feedback by having users fill surveys and comment cards. Staff will also report back on patron verbal feedback and provide analytics of uses and users. The VR program will also keep track of which exhibits users frequented and what episodes received the most traffic. After four months of monitoring, the public relations manager will prepare and present a findings report to the library director and the Lucy-Desi Museum board of directors. Additionally all departments will prepare a SWOT analysis of the Lucille Ball Experience and that will determine what can be improved and how to continue progressing the VR station.</p>
